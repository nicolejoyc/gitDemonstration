      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Gift Bag</h3>
          <p>
            For planners<br>
            Who need a way to organize and remember gifts throughout the year<br>
            The <b>Gift Bag</b><br>
            Is a gift organizing tool<br>
            That helps prevent forgetting what to get family or friends when the time
            comes around<br>
            Unlike a typical notes app<br>
            Our product is focused only on gift ideas, making it easier to remember, and 
            more convenient to store and organize them
          </p>

          <h3>Collecting America</h3>
          <p>

            That allows collectors to keep specific details about the coins
            in their collection<br>
            Unlike using a physical coin map<br>
            Our product is virtual, as well as dynamic, so you can add coins
            that might not have a place on a map
          </p>

          <h3>Paw Prints</h3>

            Who needs to find or report a lost pet<br>
            The <b>Paw Prints</b><br>
            Is a pet locater tool<br>
            That allows convenient communication between finders and seekers<br>
            Unlike Facebook or other social media to ask for help<br>
